# Learn LateX

This is a simple repository for learning LateX.

The main source of setting LateX mentioned in this repository come from a [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/166523064).

I included my settings file for VSCode so that the configuration can be reproduced easily.


#### Some Settings
1. Keyboard shortcut I added for Recipe compiling: `Shift + Alt + T`.
